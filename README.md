Accuracy of Visualization, Bar Charts & ML Model on Dataset

üìå Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset using data visualization and machine learning techniques.

Bar charts are used to explore categorical data, showing distributions, comparisons, and trends.

A Machine Learning (ML) model is applied to predict outcomes from the dataset.

The model‚Äôs accuracy is evaluated and compared with visual insights to validate reliability.


This combination of visualization and ML highlights how visual exploration complements predictive analytics in data-driven decision-making.
